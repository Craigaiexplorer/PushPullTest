# ⚡ Bolt.new AI Pre-Hackathon Jam

Welcome to our **Pre-Hackathon Playground**! 🎉

This is an informal, exploratory session ahead of our main hackathon. The goal is to **get comfortable with Bolt.new AI**, test its capabilities, and build random, fun mini-projects—**not the actual hackathon project**.

---

## 🧠 What’s the Plan?

We’ll spend time:
- Getting familiar with the **Bolt.new AI interface and workflow**
- Exploring its features: prompts, automation, integrations, etc.
- Trying out small test projects and creative ideas
- Collaborating, experimenting, and sharing what we learn

This is a **low-pressure environment** to tinker and test—bring your curiosity!
